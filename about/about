Disclaimer
You can use this watchface freely.
I will not provide any support.
I will not modify anything at your request.
I will not answer your letters and your questions and your comments.
Because I made this watchface for myself and for my family. And it is the best for us. If you like it, use it. If you don't like it, don't use it.
I don't care.
You can modify it yourself. The code is open.

Please read!
All settings can be changed on the watch. Without Garmin Connect or Garmin Express.

Weather forecast requires API key and found location
Generate API key on openweathermap.org and paste it in the settings. It is more convenient to use Garmin Connect, but you can use a watch.
Start a GPS workout to capture the location. After the location is determined, start the watchface.
The watchface has many features. I'm too lazy to list them. Anyone who is interested will understand itself.
